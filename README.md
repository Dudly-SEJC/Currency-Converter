A Python program for converting certain currencies.
*NOTE* This program utilizes an API for the currency's conditional values (since conversion rates may update in a timely manner)
The program will need internet access to run properly. 
To use the program, choose the currency you currently have on the left, and choose the currency you would like to convert to.
The entry box below the currency choices is where you will put the number value of the currency.
Then convert.
